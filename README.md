  <li><h4>Approximate date:</h4>First semester of 2020</li>
  <li><h4>Purpose:</h4>This repo corresponds to the final project of the Constraint Programming course at college. The main problem is a scheduling problem of actors filming scenes for a movie, with some additional constraints, like preferences over people (some actors like each other, some don't) and the optimization factor is saving money (the more an actor is in the physical place of filming, the more he/she gets paid). This is an NP-hard problem, and in the solution we use techniques such as breaking symmetries in order to have a better time response of the solution.</li>
